&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 2&lt;/strong&gt;
This concept is relying on users being managed via Active Directory or LDAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jira administration has many aspects and points which can be tuned. One of those is how jira is connected to domain/ldap. One of best practicies is to not to multiplicate elements when not needed. In that context Jira should be connected to Domain/LDAP and trough that connection user permissions managed. By doing so Jira Administrator will not recreate LDAP group or create other than Domain groups for local Jira usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such setup will remove user &amp;amp; group management from Jira System administrator and place it on: Project and LDAP administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project administration&lt;/strong&gt; it's nothing more than placing Domain groups under expected permission roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain groups&lt;/strong&gt;
This should be also setup carefully as Jira administration and users don't want to see all domain groups being synchronized with Jira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that goal domain group can be tagged with extenssionAttribute(n) or any other not used parameter. In my case I'll stay with &lt;code&gt;extenssionAttribute1=Jira&lt;/code&gt;. This way each group tagged with it will be "selected" to be used in Jira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now User Directory need to be updated under "Group Object Filter" to be like:
&lt;code&gt;(&amp;amp;(objectCategory=Group)(extenssionAttribute1=*Jira*))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;extenssionAttribute1=*Jira*&lt;/code&gt; - (*) in that filter is because we can go one step further and want to use same group among few applications eg: Jira and Confluence. Then Domain attribute can look like: &lt;code&gt;extenssionAttribute1=Jira,Confluence,Bitbucket&lt;/code&gt;. Filter will do the job and select only those groups which are matching specified application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea of using group attribute has also another advantage. User Directory can have "Base DN" pointing to top of our AD, like: &lt;code&gt;o=example,c=com&lt;/code&gt;, but filter will match and synchronize only those elements which are needed. Maintainers (Active Directory and  Operations) will not need to think "Where group need to be created to make it visible in Jira?" or "Can we move group to different OU?". Grups can be anywhere within AD tree structure and will remain usable for Jira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jira administrator I can rant some while on Jira features as well as users forcing their ideas to spam others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As jira by default makes you watcher of any:
- commented issue
- created issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing above user to "protect" himself can have saved special query in his favourite filters. Speciality of that JQL rely on it's result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;watcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;currentUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Unresolved&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above query will return list of all not "Closed" issues which can be moved, commented or changed in anyway which will create notification sent to your mailbox. Thus it seems to be good idea to go trough such JQL and verify is there anything what you can "Stop watching".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batching notifications&lt;/em&gt;
In addition to above JQL it would be good to verify which Jira version is running in your company. Starting from Jira 8 Server version Jira does provide email improvement called "batch notifications". It's enabled by default in Jira or can be enabled by administrator when disabled. Administrator can reach that feature under "cog" &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Batching email notifications &lt;a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver080/configuring-email-notifications-967897768.html"&gt;Atlassian KB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
